title: "How to Invite to Support Patrol"
---
`@support-patrol` is a role for people who have been actively helping others in the Astro community, for example:
- Helping in `#support` threads
- Helping in channels like `#general`, `#starlight`, `#vercel`, `#netlify`, etc.
- Helping in Astro repos with issues and PRs
- Helping outside of the Astro community in places like Stack Overflow, Twitter/X, Mastodon, Reddit, Twitch/Youtube streams, etc.

## Nominating

If you are in `@support-patrol` and you have noticed someone actively helping others you can invite them to the role.

To nominate someone, post a message in the `#support-squad` channel nominating the person, for example: 

> I want to nominate `@[name]` for `@support-patrol`, they have been really great at helping people in `#support` threads!

## Voting

Once someone has been nominated for the `@support-patrol` role, anyone can vote for the person using a positive emoji reaction on the nomination message like `+1` or 👍.

If you do not agree with a nomination or don't know anything about the nominee, it is best to absatin from voting. If the vote passes the nominee will be able to the channel history.

If the nomination message recieves more than 3 positive reactions after 24-48 hours than it is considered a passing vote.

## Inviting

After a nomination vote has passed, the nominator can send a private DM to invite the nominee or ask a `@support-mod` to do it.

This invitation should include:

- An invitation to the role
- An explanation of what the role is
- A thank you for their help

This is an opportunity for us to recognize the efforts that you have already demonstrated, and to let other community members know that you are a trusted support giver. Becoming a Support Patrol member means you're a friendly presence in the community, someone others can trust for guidance.
