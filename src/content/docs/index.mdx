We use this site to document ways to help out in Astro community support efforts.

## How can you contribute to support?

- Answering questions #support (note: mention #support-ai?)
  - providing a reference from Astro docs is highly recommended (see knowledge base)
  - providing a working example that solves their problem
  - Instead of writing code and fixing a problem for one person, think of adding an example to an existing set or start your own, that can speed up the next case with the same issue.
- Answering questions on StackOverflow or Reddit (note: expand to give brief instructions & links to SO guides)
- sorting github withastro/astro issues, contributing with comments, tests, reproductions, or even fixes.
- transfer in both directions, real issues from Discord to github and issues that are more of troubleshooting step by step discussion can also go from github to Discord.

## Roles

- **Support Squad**: Anyone can assign themselves the "Support Squad" role in the `Channels & Roles` section of the [Astro Discord](https://astro.build/chat). This helps let others know you're interested in helping, and may be occasionally mentioned for support related events.
- **Support Patrol**

## Providing support

### Searching for previous answers

Discord provides built-in search features, both for the server, and for each forum. The server-wide search is much more feature complete, and is the one we'd recommend using.

### Handling situations

*reusable phrases, how to exit a situation, etc.*

## Knowledge base

- [Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build) guides, API reference, and everything else!
- Examples: [astro.new](https://astro.new/), [themes](https://astro.build/themes/), community repos.
- [Releases & changelogs](https://github.com/withastro/astro/releases)
- Existing answered questions help you learn from the experienced members of the community
