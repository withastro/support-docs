We use this site to document ways to help out in Astro community support efforts.

## How can you Contribute to Support?

- Answering questions in `#support` (note: mention `#support-ai`?)
  - Providing a reference from Astro docs is highly recommended (see [knowledge base](#knowledge-base))
  - Providing a working example that solves their problem
  - Instead of providing a specific solution, try to provide a general solution that can be applied to similar problems
- Answering questions on [Support Squid](https://get.supportsquid.ink) StackOverflow or Reddit (note: expand to give brief instructions & links to SO guides)
- Sorting GitHub withastro/astro issues, contributing with comments, tests, reproductions, or even fixes.
- How support squad can help docs: https://contribute.docs.astro.build/roles/support-squad/

## Roles

- **Support Squad**: Anyone can assign themselves the "Support Squad" role in the `Channels & Roles` section of the [Astro Discord server](https://astro.build/chat). This helps let others know you're interested in helping, and may be occasionally mentioned for support related events.
- **Support Patrol**: A role for people who have been actively helping others in the Astro community.

## Providing Support

### Searching for Previous Answers

Discord provides built-in search features, both for the server, and for each forum. The server-wide search is much more feature complete, and is the one we'd recommend using.

### Handling Situations

*reusable phrases, how to exit a situation, etc.*

## Knowledge Base
